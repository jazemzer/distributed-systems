# Make it stick

## Learning is misunderstood

* Rereading text and rapid-fire repetition (massed practice) 
	- is transitory, least productive and makes no difference in the long run
	- creates an illusion of mastery
* Recalling facts, concepts or events from memory 
	- is more effective strategy
* Spacing out practice or interleaving recall practice 
	- creates long lasting learning
* Trying to solve the problem before being taught increases learning
* Research doesn't back up the idea of auditory or visual learner
* Testing as a tool for learning
	- Without quizzing we overestimate mastery
	- Testing identifies shows unknown unknowns
* Elaboration - Expressing a concept in one's own words strengthens learning
* Extracting key ideas, organizing into mental models and connecting to prior knowledge helps in complex mastery
* Learning is stronger when it matters

Mastery = Readily available Knowledge + understanding of how to use it

### Takeaway

* Quiz yourselves regularly
* Elaborate or take notes in your own words

## Retrieve to learn
