# Welcome here!

I'm not an expert in systems design but I've lately started reading more about designing distributed systems. And this site is an attempt to document my notes both for sharing and future reference. 

As I begin this journey, though I have a list of topics to cover, I don't have a concrete structure in my mind to organize these notes. But I hope over time I should be able to find a structure and reorganize them.
